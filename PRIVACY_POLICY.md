## Portal Plus: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Portal Plus chrome extension!

This extension is developed by Omar Othman.

As an avid apps user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (student portal login information, grades/marks or preferences (like theme, etc.)) created by you are stored locally on your browser only, and can simply be erased by uninstalling the extension.

If you find any security questions or concerns regarding your data and privacy please send me an email and I will surely help you.

Yours sincerely,
Omar Othamn.
